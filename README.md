## Overview

`opendig` is a command-line tool that extends the functionality of `dig` to be compatible with the Openname System. Specifically, it adds support for the resolution of blockchain user handles.

ONS extends DNS in a backwards-compatible way by supporting the registration and resolution of:

+ user handles on the blockchain (currently supported by opendig)
+ domains on the blockchain (in the design phase)

#### ONS = ICANN DNS + blockchain handles + blockchain domains

User calls to opendig will return user data in a standard schema.

## Configuration

OpenDig comes with pre-configured default servers 8.8.8.8 (public DNS server by Google) and 162.243.253.65, 107.170.167.141 (public ONS server by OneName). We *strongly* recommend using a local config file, and using your own servers. Instructions for setting up your own server can be found [here](https://github.com/opennamesystem/ons-server/blob/master/doc/build-debian.md).

```
$ touch ~/.opendig
$ vi ~/.opendig
```
A sample config looks like this:

```
[dns]
servers = 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

[ons]
#all these servers are queried and a check is performed that they return the same data
#to reduce trust on any single party, use your own servers or multiple public servers
servers = 162.243.253.65, 107.170.167.141

[namecoind]
port = 8332
user = opennamesystem
passwd = opennamesystem
use_https = True
```
